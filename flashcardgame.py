Q1. A flashcard is a card having information on both sides, which can be used as an
      aid in memorization. Flashcards usually have a question on one side and an
      answer on the other. Particularly in this article, we are going to create
      flashcards that will be having a word and its meaning.

class Flashcards:
    def __init__(self, word, meaning):
        self.word = word
        self.meaning = meaning

    def __str__(self):
        return f"the entered word is  {self.word}  and its meaning is {self.meaning}"


flash = []
while True:
    word = input("Enter the word: ")
    meaning = input("Enter the meaning of that word: ")
    flash.append(Flashcards(word, meaning))

    option = int(input("Press 0 to enter the next word and its meaning else to exit print any other key: "))

    if option:
        break
